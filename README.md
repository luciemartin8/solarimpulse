# Solar Impulse Project, Trials and data samples
This project was created to sort through emails that are sent through Solar Impulses solutions explorer. Individuals can use the solutions explorer to contact a solution. However, not all emails are necessarily relevant to the company solution. This project utilized a combination of prompt engineering and a rule-based python script to classify the email as relevant or irrelevant.
